# Financial Projections Parser

A simple algorithm that parses Excel-like financial projections to extract key business assumptions and relationships, enabling scenario analysis and budget modeling.

## Overview

This project solves the problem of extracting meaningful insights from financial spreadsheets. Instead of simply storing cell values, it analyzes the underlying patterns and relationships to create a compact, queryable model of the business logic.

## Key Features

- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically detects growth rates, step changes, and calculation relationships
- **Assumption Extraction**: Identifies key business assumptions that drive the model
- **Scenario Analysis**: Enables "what-if" modeling by varying key assumptions
- **Format Flexibility**: Works with varying sheet formats without hardcoded positions

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
// for example npm start test.xlsx
npm start [fileName]
```

This will parse the provided financial projections example and show:

- Detected growth patterns
- Extracted assumptions
- Identified relationships
- Scenario analysis capabilities

### Example Output
